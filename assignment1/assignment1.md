# Introduction and Abstract

The Raven's Progressive Matrices test (RPM) is an intelligence test that consists of 60 questions, where each question is presented to the test-taker in visual format.  Each question consists of a logical sequence of geometric symbols, and the test-taker must select, from multiple choices, the correct missing element that successfully completes the pattern.  We will herein design a cognative system    (KBAI agent) that uses semantic networks to organize, store and otherwise represent the knowledge necessary for an agent to read, reason about and answer an RPM question. 

Note that the RPM tests has no letters and no numbers, only logical sequences expressed through geometric symbols.  Therefore the process of answering  answering a given RPM question, whether the test-taker is human or computer, generally involves:
- interpreting and encoding the information contained in the question
- analyzing the information 
- selecting and outputting the (hopefully correct) answer

We will use semantic networks to represent the information contained in a given question in a form that the agent can utilize to reason about the question and ultimately output an answer.  The semantic networks consists of objects which we will categorize as geometric shapes, and transformations that these shapes may undergo.  We will represent the shapes and the transformations that the shapes may undergo as nodes and vertices, respectively.  Thus we will encode the information in a given RPM question in an organized way such that the agent may reason about the question, or analyze the information, using several different non-mutually exclusive options such as [situational calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situation_calculus), directed graph logic, etc.

In order to answer a RPM question the agent must read the problem, interpret the input


But it gets harder, why is this best
this methodology should be used because each layer of clusterfuckedness is no more than a adding a few more nodes/verticees in a non-directed cyclical graph that models the situation

Any cognative system that attempts to solve such a problem must 

Difficult because 
when we take in an image, we must interpret the objects in that image
objects may undergo transformations from one image to the next





- identify and represent the objects in a given image
- identify and represent the relationships between the objects in the image
- identify the objects in the next image
- determine if they are some transformation of objects in the original image
- identify and store those transformations
  - the transformations are vertices

- identify the relationships of the transformations of that object 

Our semantic network will utilize two simple concepts to represent the knowledg: objects and transformations on those objects.

Objects will be shapes
- shapes can have properties,
